This is a project for EE551 python.# EE551project_2048

First, we start with our state pciture which is our state loop.

Rules:
1 when the game begins, we generate two numbers which are randomly 2 or 4
2 WASD stand for actions: UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT, every action generates a number(2or4)
3 biggest number is 2048? you win
4 game field is fullfilled and you can't move? you lose

In "def main(stdscr):" we establish the game state loop
In other parts, mainly in "def GameField", we add our functions and details
